# What is SpringBoot?

SpringBoot uses completely new development model to make Java Development very easyby avoiding some tedious development steps and boilerplate code and configuration.

SpringBoot framework is from "The Spring Team" to ease the bootstrapping and development of new Spring Applications.

SpringBoot makes it easy to create a stand-alone, production-grade spring based applications that you can "Just Run". We take and opinionated view of the spring platform and third party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most SpringBoot applications need very little Spring configuration.

SpringBoot Framework is Auto dependency resolution, Auto configuration, Management endpoints, Embedded HTTP servers(Tomcat, Jetty) and SpringBoot CLI.
